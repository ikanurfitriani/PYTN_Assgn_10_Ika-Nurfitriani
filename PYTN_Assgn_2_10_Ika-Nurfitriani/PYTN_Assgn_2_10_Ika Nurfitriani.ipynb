    "## Short Description of The Assignment\n",
    "This assignment is a project intended as the **second** assignment in a self-study class at PT Hacktivate Teknologi Indonesia. In this project, we will analyze the NYC Property Sales data from September 2016 to September 2017. Students are asked to formulate questions, then answer and drawing conclusions from the overall analysis that has been made. This assignment is made by taking into account all the assessment rubrics that have been set and will be checked by the teacher of each class."

    "## Project Overview\n",
    "Dataset NYC Property Sales From Kaggle. This dataset is a record of every building or building unit (apartment, etc) sold in New York City property market over a 12-month period from September 2016 to September 2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset contains the location, address, type, sale price, and sale date of building units sold. A reference on the trickier fields:\n",
    "1. BOROUGH: A digit code for the borough the property is located in; in order these are Manhattan (1), Bronx (2), Brooklyn (3), Queens (4), and Staten Island (5).\n",
    "2. BLOCK; LOT: The combination of borough, block, and lot forms a unique key for property in New York City. Commonly called a BBL.\n",
    "3. BUILDING CLASS AT PRESENT and BUILDING CLASS AT TIME OF SALE: The type of building at various points in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that because this is a financial transaction dataset, there are some points that need to be kept in mind:\n",
    "- Many sales occur with a nonsensically small dollar amount: $0 most commonly. These sales are actually transfers of deeds between parties: for example, parents transferring ownership to their home to a child after moving out for retirement.\n",
    "- This dataset uses the financial definition of a building/building unit, for tax purposes. In case a single entity owns the building in question, a sale covers the value of the entire building. In case a building is owned piecemeal by its residents (a condominium), a sale refers to a single apartment (or group of apartments) owned by some individual."

    "Pada bagian ini, saya akan merangkum hasil keseluruhan analisis yang telah saya lakukan. Berikut hasil keseluruhan analisis di atas:\n",
    "1. Rata-rata dari harga jual (SALE PRICE) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 474105.62593740626. Lalu rata-rata dari luas total semua lantai bangunan (GROSS SQUARE FEET) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 2096.006299370063. Dan rata-rata dari luas tanah properti (LAND SQUARE FEET) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 2222.5992400759924.\n",
    "2. Median dari harga jual (SALE PRICE) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 400000.0. Lalu median dari luas total semua lantai bangunan (GROSS SQUARE FEET) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 2040.0. Dan median dari luas tanah properti (LAND SQUARE FEET) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 2000.0.\n",
    "3. Modus dari tahun properti dibangun (YEAR BUILT) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 1920 dengan kemunculan sebanyak 1354. Lalu modus dari luas total semua lantai bangunan (GROSS SQUARE FEET) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 2400 dengan kemunculan sebanyak 145. Dan modus dari luas tanah properti (LAND SQUARE FEET) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 2000 dengan kemunculan sebanyak 1846.\n",
    "4. Range/perbedaan antara harga jual (SALE PRICE) tertinggi dan terendah di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 2100000.0. Dan range/perbedaan antara luas total semua lantai bangunan (GROSS SQUARE FEET) tertinggi dan terendah di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 4048.0.\n",
    "5. Variance dari harga jual (SALE PRICE) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 265398564019.92996. Lalu variance dari luas total semua lantai bangunan (GROSS SQUARE FEET) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 536218.190660314. Dan variance dari luas tanah properti (LAND SQUARE FEET) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 413281.1535754159.\n",
    "6. Standard deviation dari harga jual (SALE PRICE) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 515168.48119807366. Lalu standard deviation dari luas total semua lantai bangunan (GROSS SQUARE FEET) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 732.2692064127195. Dan standard deviation dari luas tanah properti (LAND SQUARE FEET) di wilayah Brooklyn adalah 642.8694685357331.\n",
    "7. Dari grafik pertama yang ditampilkan dan tidak adanya skewness maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa probability distribution harga penjualan (SALE PRICE) di wilayah Staten Island sudah berdistribusi normal. Dan dari grafik kedua yang ditampilkan dan tidak adanya skewness maka dapat disimpulkan bahwa probability distribution harga penjualan (SALE PRICE) di daerah Maspeth juga sudah berdistribusi normal.\n",
    "8. Confidence interval luas tanah properti (LAND SQUARE FEET) di daerah BAYSIDE adalah 2898.8429408871393 - 3061.245226166225, berarti nilai suatu sample mean berada antara rentang tersebut. Dan confidence interval luas total semua lantai bangunan (GROSS SQUARE FEET) di daerah BAYSIDE adalah 1650.2795534194877 - 1763.613718042229, berarti nilai suatu sample mean berada antara rentang tersebut.\n",
    "9. Berdasarkan hasil uji hipotesis menggunakan z-test dengan alternative two-sided, didapatkan bahwa H0 ditolak karena p-value < 0.05. Jadi dapat disimpulkan bahwa harga jual properti (SALE PRICES OF PROPERTIES) di wilayah Brooklyn dan Queens tidak sama."
